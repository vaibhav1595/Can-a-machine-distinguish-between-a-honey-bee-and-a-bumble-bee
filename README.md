## Project Description
Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data.

This project is a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision

- **Image Loading and Processing** - This project is the **FIRST** part of a series of projects, in this I will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data
- **Predict Species from Images** - This project is the **SECOND** part of a series of projects, in this I will then build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees given an image of these insects.
- **Deep Learning with Images** - This project is the **THIRD** part of a series of projects, in this I will build a simple deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees, then load a pre-trained model for evaluation. You will use keras, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy, among other popular Python libraries.
